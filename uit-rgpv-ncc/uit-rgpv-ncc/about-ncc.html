    <section>
      <h2>History of NCC</h2>
      <p>
        The National Cadet Corps (NCC) was established in India on 16th July 1948 through the NCC Act of the Indian Parliament. It was inspired by the University Corps formed during British rule, aiming to make military training accessible to students. 
        After independence, the need for a strong, youth-focused organization to instill patriotism, discipline, and leadership was recognized, and NCC was born under the Ministry of Defence. Today, it stands as the largest uniformed youth organization in the world, shaping countless cadets into responsible citizens and future leaders.
